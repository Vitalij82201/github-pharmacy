Pharmacy Management System
This project is a system for managing both online and offline pharmacy operations, aimed at automating product sales, inventory tracking, order processing, and customer interaction.

📌 Project Idea
The application is designed to support two modes of operation:

🛒 Online Pharmacy – users can browse products, create accounts, place orders, and receive confirmation emails.

🏪 Offline Pharmacy (in-store mode) – functionality for pharmacists to manage stock, generate receipts, and confirm sales directly at the physical location.

⚙️ Current Implementation
📦 Back-end: Java 17 + Spring Boot + Maven

🧪 Simple REST API for user registration, account confirmation, and product management

💾 Database integration using JPA/Hibernate (easily adaptable to PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)

🛠 In Progress
The project is currently at an early stage – a Java Maven-based back-end is in place.
Planned next steps include:

🌐 Building a front-end using TypeScript + React

💡 Full integration with the existing REST API

☁️ Deployment to a cloud platform (e.g., Render, Vercel, or Railway)

🚀 Roadmap
User authentication/authorization (JWT or OAuth2)

Admin panel for managing products and users

Online payment integration

Email notifications and account confirmation

Responsive mobile-friendly design
